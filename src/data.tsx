    description: 'The Living Legend. The Logo. Big J. The Hand. By whatever name, he deserves to head any greatest list in the PBA. He was the talismanic leader of two fabled franchises, standing at the forefront of Toyota in its epic rivalry with Crispa and later becoming the heart and soul of generations of never-say-die Ginebra teams. He played until he was 51 and capped his career by serving as the coach of the first all-pro team that took part in the Asian Games, leading the side to a silver medal.',

He won four league MVP awards in a long, one-of-a-kind career studded with championships with Toyota, Tanduay, and San Miguel.',

    description: 'He belonged to the leagues first batch of gunners, the Philippines answer to Korean deadshot Shin Dong Pa in the 70s. But the leagues first MVP showed during the course of his career that he was more scorer than pure shooter, bedevilling defenders with his classic pump fake and ability to score from the post. He did all these while weaving the leagues biggest comeback story, returning from a career-threatening knee injury to star for U-Tex and later Great Taste.',

Before them, the prototype slotman was big but largely uncoordinated and awkward. Guidaben gave the indomitable Fernandez a worthy adversary in the glory days of the Crispa-Toyota rivalry, and was one of the key reasons why the Redmanizers got to collect all those championships.',

Paras was an overpowering presence inside the paint, yet had the quickness and touch of a small forward. At Formula Shell, the 6-4 slotman teamed up with college teammate Ronnie Magsanoc to form one of the best guard-center combinations seen in the league.",
